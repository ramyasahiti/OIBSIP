Task 1 â€“ Iris Flower Classification | Oasis Infobyte Internship
As part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte, the first task was to train a Machine Learning model that can learn from the measurements of Iris flower species and classify them into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
I decided to take it a step further by comparing the performance of multiple algorithms:
ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression
ðŸ”¹ Decision Tree
ðŸ”¹ Random Forest
ðŸ”¹ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
After preprocessing and scaling the data, all models achieved an impressive 100% accuracy on the test set. 

Task 2 - Car Price Prediction | Oasis Infobyte Internship
Trained a machine learning model that predicts the price of used cars based on various features like year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership.
Built a complete pipeline involving data preprocessing, encoding, scaling, and model comparison.
Compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, with Random Forest performing the best in accuracy and reliability.

Task 3 - Email Spam Detection | Oasis Infobyte internship
Developed an Email Spam Detection model using Python and Machine Learning.
Trained on real-world email data, the model learns to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages with 98% accuracy using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

Task 4 â€“ Sales Prediction using ML | Oasis Infobyte Internship
Built a regression model in Python to predict future product sales based on advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper platforms.
This project highlights how data-driven insights can guide smarter marketing decisions and budget allocation.
